ENHANCING URBAN SAFETY THROUGH A COMPUTER VISION-BASED WILDLIFE DETECTION AND NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS.

This project uses a machine learning model trained using the YoloV8 to detect and identify wild animals, specifically lions and hyenas. The program runs on a raspberry pi model 4B with the input acquired from a the rpi's camera module. Upon detection of an animal, the program sends an sms notification to the relevant authorities/ residents warning them about the presence of a wild animal in the area.
